      <h1>Number Recognition Project</h1>
      <p>This is a personal progress report to skills in machine learning. My long term goal with this project is to create a classifier that can recognize any handwritten number with n number of digits.

        This was created in Jupyter Notebook and has several comparisons of different types of machine learning algorithms from simple linear regression to Gradient Descent</p>
